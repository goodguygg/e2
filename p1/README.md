## Game planning
_In plain english - no code - think through how you'll make this game work. Example:_
+ _Generate random number between 2 and 12, assign it to player variable._
+ _Generate 2 random numbers between 1 and 6 and assign them to 2 dice variables._
+ _Sum the dice variable numbers._
+ _If the sum is equal to player choice, assign value "wins" to game result variable, else assignt "loses"._
+ _Return the results and display them on the page._
